  </p>
  <p>
    Fred is a 6-axis myCobot 320-Pi robot. He is responsible for dispensing, curing resin, and looking cool.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-3">Background</h2>
  <p class="lead text-light">Existing Method</p>
  <p>
    Before Fred came to save the day, employees manually inserted plastic tabs into each desired plug slot, breaking them off from a molded hexagonal connector. This process was time consuming, boring, repetitive, straining on the hands, and prone to human error.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-3">Value Proposition</h2>
  <p>
    We replace the manual process with an automated system that automates a boring and repetitive task, prevents strain on employee hands, removes the need for molded parts, and eliminates human error. We do this with the help of Fred, a 6-axis robot that dispenses and cures resin in the desired plug slots. We also provide a web app that allows nontechnical users to control and update the process.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-3">The KeyAssembler</h2>
  <p class="lead text-light">Process</p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Employee loads plug trays with new plugs.</li>
      <li>Employee creates a plug config on the web app.</li>
      <li>Employee starts a new plug job on the web app.</li>
      <li>Web app publishes the job to an application programmable interface (API).</li>
      <li>Robot gets information about the job by visiting the API using the Internet.</li>
      <li>Robot dispenses resin for the desired plug configuration.</li>
      <li>Robot uses UV lights to cure the resin.</li>
      <li>Robot sends a message to the web app API telling it the job status.</li>
      <li>Employee sees the job is done and replaces the plugs with a new batch.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>

  <p class="lead text-light">Web App Component</p>
  <p>
    The web app component is what you are looking at right now. It is a web app that allows nontechnical users to create plug configurations and start plug jobs. It also allows users to see status updates, read documentation, view insights, and more.
  </p>

  <p class="lead text-light">Robotics Component</p>
  <p>
    The robotics component consists of a 6-axis robot that dispenses and cures resin in the desired plug slots, base plate aligner that ensures consistent placement, and plug tray that holds plugs. It is controlled by the web app component.
